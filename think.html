                <p>In today's culture, we are overwhelmed by passive content consumption and artificial intelligence. Actively cultivating independent thought is going to be more important now than ever, not just for personal fulfillment but also for preserving our individuality.</p>

                <p>Social media algorithms prey upon the sloth and lack of friction in society today. You can tailor your feed to consistently feed you content that drowns out your inner voice, preventing your inner monologue from having the chance to breathe. On top of that, the algorithms are tailored to what you personally like, enjoy, and interact with. We are stuck in echo chambers built by algorithms tailored precisely to our likes. Breaking free of that bubble means seeking out ideas and content that genuinely challenge our existing beliefs.</p>

                <p>On a separate note, The widespread success of artificial intelligence is no doubt a great thing, but the way it is being consumed is not healthy. A friend of mine initiated a thought provoking question, inquiring the ability of AI to <a href="https://x.com/KieranV77/status/1904366023068799250" target="_blank">replace our cognitive function</a>; our ability to think. We should intentionally spend more time alone with our thoughts, earnestly exploring what interests us.</p>

                <p>If we lose our ability to think, a fundamental, if not the fundamental aspect of our physiology and genome that separates us from machine, what do we have? We should be actively spending time thinking, actively spending time conversing with our <a href="https://x.com/vedantnair__/status/1903271353882644992" target="_blank">inner dialogue</a>. This will allow you to actually learn, and get closer to your true self. We all have things that appeal to us more than others. Deeply question what draws you to the things you enjoy—keep asking 'why?' until you uncover truths you have never consciously acknowledged. When you are alone, it is quiet. You have the choice to think about something. It's up to you to decide what that will be though.</p>

                <p>Deep thinking is challenging because it forces us beyond easy answers, compelling us to question beliefs we comfortably accept. This process can be unsettling, exposing truths we have long avoided, but therein lies its revolutionary power. There is something beautiful about this.</p>

                <p>Our individuality fuels culture, shaped not by mindless consumption but by active creation. Producing original thoughts or art not only expresses who we are—it also attracts people who deeply resonate with us. Everyone has distinctive interests, but many never sincerely explore them. This is because they are not truly interested, or simply due to laziness. We can consume, but it is a shame to not produce. Production is where the culture lies, and it is how we establish ourselves into the world. It is also how we invite the people who we really should be around into our lives.</p>

                <p>On the topic of what to think about, that is totally up to you. The whole point of this is to be more honest with your time and the remarkable gift it is we have to think, question, and choose. As long as you are candid with yourself about what you are doing everyday, and the reason behind it. Explore your past, and discover what things interested you. It could even be random pictures in your camera roll that at one time appealed to you, but you never questioned why. Get out of your traditional echo chamber, and go consume content you would not normally, or something that challenges your very core being. This is how you will prove conviction in the things you believe; by figuring out why it may be wrong, and then disproving that.</p>

                <p>There are often points in our day where we can choose to opt in to finding ourselves, or opt out. It could be during a walk to class, while you cook a meal, or even while you are in the shower. It requires an unfeigned desire as it will not be easy to question everything you believe you like, but I encourage you to try. At the root of this, you will learn more about yourself every time.</p>

                <p>Exploring art, poetry, and fiction is a great application of this. These mediums are critical in the fact that they are the individual production of creators which helped define culture at their relevant lifetime. You have to contiually question the poet's references, word choice, rhyme or meter. You have to continually question the artist's use of color, angle or perspective of the piece, subject location, etc. What's also captivating about exploring these two fields is the room for interpretation. There is value in what the creator thinks, and there is tremendous value in understanding what you think.</p>

                <p>We are transitioning to a world where mechanical tasks become menial, and offloaded to machine. I encourage you to explore new ideas and experiences, as this is the only way you can figure out what you do and do not enjoy. Develop your own opinions on subjects. Figure out what contributes to your idea creation, as that will soon be all we really have left. Understand your individuality, win back your soul, and create.</p>
